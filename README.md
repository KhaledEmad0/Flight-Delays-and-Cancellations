# Flight-Delays-and-Cancellations
In this project, we'll create visualizations to reveal insights from the Flight Delays and Cancellations data set. We will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set Using Tableau. This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015.
